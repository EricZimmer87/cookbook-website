# Cookbook Website (Cooking Made EZ)

This is a full-stack web application for discovering, creating, and sharing recipes. It is built with **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. Docker was used for development. This is my first application built with React and Spring Boot. It was used as a learning experience for the two frameworks.

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure JWT-based login/registration
  - Role-based access (Admin, Contributor, Viewer)
  - Forgot your password sends email with password reset link

- **Recipes**
  - Create, read, update, delete recipes
  - Search, sort, and filter recipes
  - Add a review for a recipe
  - Make notes about recipes for personal changes you made
  - Save recipes to favorites

## Deployment

The app is deployed by bundling the React frontend into the Spring Boot backend and hosting on **Render**.
The MySQL database is hosted on **Clever Cloud**.
